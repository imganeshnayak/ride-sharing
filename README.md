# RiiDE
RiiDE is a carpooling app that lets users search through, join or create trips to any given destination, and also helps managing the pricing, passengers, contact info and timings.

This app was roughly developed in a month from week-end to week-end as an end of cycle CS Bachelor's degree project, so it will not get any further updates after it's done.
